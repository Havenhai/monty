They are both types of linear data structures, meaning that the elements are stored in a sequence, but they differ in how data is accessed and removed. Stacks follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, while queues follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Let's take a closer look at each of them:

Stacks (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out):

Description: Stacks are data structures that represent a collection of elements, with two primary operations: "push" and "pop." Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the "top."

Operations:

Push: This operation is used to add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: This operation removes and returns the top element of the stack.
Example: Think of a stack of plates. You add plates to the top and remove them from the top. The last plate added is the first one to be removed.

Use Cases: Stacks are commonly used in various algorithms and programming tasks. They are especially useful for tasks that require keeping track of function calls, managing undo/redo functionality, and solving problems like evaluating expressions in reverse Polish notation (RPN).

Queues (FIFO - First-In, First-Out):

Description: Queues are also collections of elements, but they follow a different principle than stacks. In queues, elements are added to the back, and they are removed from the front.

Operations:

Enqueue: This operation is used to add an element to the back of the queue.
Dequeue: This operation removes and returns the front element of the queue.
Example: Think of a queue of people waiting in line. The first person who joins the line is the first one to be served.

Use Cases: Queues are commonly used for tasks that involve managing processes or tasks in a sequential manner. Examples include task scheduling in operating systems, managing print jobs in a printer queue, and simulating scenarios like waiting lines.

To summarize, the primary difference between stacks and queues lies in how elements are added and removed. Stacks use the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed, while queues use the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. These data structures have various applications and are essential components of many algorithms and systems in computer science and programming.
